# PyCisTopic

pycisTopic is a Python framework for analyzing single-cell chromatin accessibility data (like scATAC-seq). It uses cis-topic modeling (topic modeling applied to genomic regions) to identify groups of co-accessible regions—called cis-topics—that represent shared regulatory programs across cells.
